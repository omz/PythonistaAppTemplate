This module contains the base classes for Simpy's resource system.

:class:`BaseResource` defines the abstract base resource. The request for
putting something into or getting something out of a resource is modeled as an
event that has to be yielded by the requesting process. :class:`Put` and
:class:`Get` are the base event types for this.

    All resources are bound to a specific :class:`~simpy.core.Environment`

    You can :meth:`put()` something into the resources or :meth:`get()`
    something out of it. Both methods return an event that the requesting
    process has to ``yield``.

    resource is not full (put) or not empty (get)), that event is triggered
    immediately.

    If a resources is too full or too empty to perform a put or get request,
    the event is pushed to the *put_queue* or *get_queue*. An event is popped
    from one of these queues and triggered as soon as the corresponding
    operation is possible.

    :meth:`put()` and :meth:`get()` only provide the user API and the general
    framework and should not be overridden in subclasses. The actual behavior
