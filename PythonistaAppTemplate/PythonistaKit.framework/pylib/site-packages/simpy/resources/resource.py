"""
This module contains all :class:`Resource` like resources.

These resources can be used by a limited number of processes at a time (e.g.,
a gas station with a limited number of fuel pumps). Processes *request* these
resources to become a user (or to own them) and have to *release* them once
they are done (e.g., vehicles arrive at the gas station, use a fuel-pump, if
one is available, and leave when they are done).

Requesting a resources is modeled as "putting a process' token into the
resources" and releasing a resources correspondingly as "getting a process'
token out of the resource". Thus, calling ``request()``/``release()`` is
equivalent to calling ``put()``/``get()``. Note, that releasing a resource will
always succeed immediately, no matter if a process is actually using a resource
or not.

Beside :class:`Resource`, there are a :class:`PriorityResource`, were processes
can define a request priority, and a :class:`PreemptiveResource` whose resource
users can be preempted by other processes with a higher priority.
