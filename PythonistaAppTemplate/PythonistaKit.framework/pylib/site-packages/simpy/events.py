"""
This *events* module contains the various event type used by the SimPy core.

The base class for all events is :class:`Event`. Though it can be directly
used, there are several specialized subclasses of it:

- :class:`Timeout`: is scheduled with a certain delay and lets processes hold
  their state for a certain amount of time.

- :class:`Initialize`: Initializes a new :class:`Process`.

- :class:`Process`: Processes are also modeled as an event so other processes
  can wait until another one finishes.

- :class:`Condition`: Events can be concatenated with ``|`` an ``&`` to either
  wait until one or both of the events are triggered.

- :class:`AllOf`: Special case of :class:`Condition`; wait until a list of
  events has been triggered.

- :class:`AnyOf`: Special case of :class:`Condition`; wait until one of a list
  of events has been triggered.

This module also defines the :exc:`Interrupt` exception.

    that accepts a single argument which is the event instances the callback

    append custom callbacks. All callbacks are executed in the order that they
    were added when the event is processed.
